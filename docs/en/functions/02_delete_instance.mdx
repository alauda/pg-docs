# Deleting an Instance

Deleting a PostgreSQL instance will remove the CR resources created and the StatefulSet, ConfigMap, Secret, PersistentVolumeClaim, and other resources created by the Postgres Operator based on the CR resources.

## Steps to Operate

<Tabs>
  <Tab label="Command Line Operations">
    If the instance does not have persistence enabled, or if you want to keep the instance's persistent data, execute the following command to delete the instance:

    ```bash
    # Directly delete the PostgreSQL instance
    kubectl -n default delete postgresql <instance-name>
    ```

    If you wish to delete the persistent storage along with the instance, perform the following commands:

    ```bash
    # Add finalizer to delete PVC
    kubectl -n default patch postgresql <instance-name> --type='merge' -p '{"metadata": {"finalizers": ["delete-pvc"]}}'

    # Delete the PostgreSQL instance and its persistent storage
    kubectl -n default delete postgresql <instance-name>
    ```

    > `delete-pvc` is a built-in keyword in the Postgres Operator, used to instruct the Operator to delete the persistent volume storage while deleting the instance.

    After deletion, you can confirm the instance status with the following command:

    ```bash
    kubectl -n default get postgresql
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab label="GUI Operations">
    1. Click **PostgreSQL** in the left navigation bar.
    2. Select the target namespace.
    3. Choose the instance you wish to delete from the instance list.
    4. On the instance details page, click the **Actions** button in the upper-right corner.
    5. Select the **Delete** option.
    6. For instances with data persistence enabled:
       - Check "Delete Persistent Volume Claim" to free up storage.
       - Leave unchecked to retain data.
    7. Enter the instance name in the confirmation box.
    8. Click **Delete**.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Precautions

1. Please ensure that data backups are made before deleting the instance.
2. The delete operation is irreversible; please proceed with caution.
3. When deleting a cluster instance, all replica nodes will also be deleted.
4. The delete operation will also remove associated monitoring, logging, and other resources.
