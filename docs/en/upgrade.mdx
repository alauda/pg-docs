3. **Resource Availability**: The cluster has sufficient resources to support the upgrade process.

## Upgrade Path Guidelines

### Consecutive Upgrade (Recommended)
- **Description**: Upgrade step-by-step through consecutive minor versions.
- **Example**: `4.1.x ‚Üí 4.2.x`

### Patch-Level Upgrade
- **Description**: Patch upgrades within the same minor version are fully compatible.
- **Example**: `4.1.0 ‚Üí 4.1.x`

### PostgreSQL Version Alignment
- **Description**: Ensure PostgreSQL version upgrades follow the operator's compatibility matrix.
- **Example**: Alauda Support for PostgreSQL `4.1.0` ‚Üí PostgreSQL `12`, `14`, or `16`

:::note
If your current PostgreSQL version is being removed in the next Alauda PostgreSQL Version, you must manually upgrade your PostgreSQL version to a supported version before upgrading to the next Alauda PostgreSQL Version. This ensures compatibility and prevents upgrade failures.
