# Introduction

## PostgreSQL Introduction

**PostgreSQL** is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system known for its reliability, feature robustness, and performance. It uses and extends the SQL language combined with many features that safely store and scale the most complicated data workloads. PostgreSQL runs on all major operating systems and has been ACID-compliant since 2001. It is widely used for various applications, from single machines to data warehouses to web services with many concurrent users.

## Alauda support for PostgreSQL Introduction

**Alauda support for PostgreSQL** is a Kubernetes-native management solution built upon the robust foundation of the Zalando Postgres Operator. It simplifies the deployment and full lifecycle management of PostgreSQL clusters within Kubernetes environments using Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs). This service automates complex operational tasks, including high availability setup, automated failover, scaling, rolling upgrades, and backup/recovery, allowing enterprises to run production-grade PostgreSQL databases effortlessly on Kubernetes.

## Key Features

The key features provided by Alauda support for PostgreSQL include:

- **Automated Operations**: Leverages the Operator pattern to automatically manage cluster deployment, configuration changes, scaling, and backup/recovery tasks, significantly reducing manual effort and potential errors.

- **High Availability (HA)**: Integrates Patroni for robust automated failover mechanisms, leader election, and cluster health monitoring, ensuring continuous database service availability.

- **Elastic Scalability**: Allows dynamic horizontal scaling (adding/removing replicas) and vertical scaling (adjusting CPU/memory resources) to adapt to changing workloads without downtime.

- **Backup and Restore**: Supports scheduled and manual backups to S3-compatible storage (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage, MinIO), enabling reliable data protection and point-in-time recovery (PITR).

- **Security Features**: Provides enterprise-grade security options, including TLS encryption for data in transit, Kubernetes RBAC integration for access control, and support for secure password management.

- **Monitoring and Logging**: Offers built-in integration with Prometheus for metrics collection and provides easy access to PostgreSQL logs, enabling comprehensive observability into database performance and health.

- **Custom Configuration**: Allows extensive customization of PostgreSQL parameters, Patroni settings, and Kubernetes resource configurations (e.g., affinity, tolerations).

## Limitations

- **Version Support**\
  Currently supports PostgreSQL versions 14 and 16 (recommended for new deployments).

- **Cluster Size**\
  A single cluster supports up to 15 replica nodes.

- **Storage Requirements**\
  Must use StorageClasses that support dynamic provisioning.

- **Kubernetes Version**\
  Requires Kubernetes version 1.19 or above.

- **Resource Requirements**: Minimum recommended configuration for a node is 2 CPU cores and 4GB of memory. Actual requirements depend on workload and cluster size.
