# Lifecycle Policy

## Version Lifecycle Timeline

Below is the lifecycle schedule for released versions of the Alauda Support for PostgreSQL:

| Alauda Support for PostgreSQL Version | Release Date | End of Support                                        |
|:-------------------------------------:|:------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------:|

## Release Policy

The Alauda Support for PostgreSQL follows a **rolling support model**:

- The life cycles of different major versions are independent of each other, and there may be multiple major versions in maintenance simultaneously.
- Each minor version remains supported **until the next minor version is officially released**.
- Each patch version shares the same lifecycle with its corresponding minor version. The release time of patch versions is not fixed and depends on factors such as the release rhythm of the PG community version, the progress of fixing critical issues and vulnerabilities, etc.


## Maintenance Policy

Alauda provides maintenance support for the Alauda Support for PostgreSQL based on its rolling support model.

During the support period of each version, Alauda provides the following services:

- **Security Updates**: Regular patches and updates in line with Alaudaâ€™s security standards.
- **Bug Fixes**: Timely fixes for critical and major issues, aligned with upstream PostgreSQL community fixes.
- **Upgrade Assistance**: Guidance and support for smooth upgrades between the Alauda Support for PostgreSQL versions.
- **Regular Maintenance**: Periodic updates to ensure the operator remains stable and compatible with the Kubernetes ecosystem.
