## Version Lifecycle Timeline

Below is the lifecycle schedule for released versions of the Alauda Support for PostgreSQL:

| Alauda Support for PostgreSQL Version | Release Date | End of Support                                          |

## Release Policy

The Alauda Support for PostgreSQL follows a **rolling support model**:

- The life cycles of different major versions are independent of each other, and there may be multiple major versions in maintenance simultaneously.
- Each minor version remains supported **until the next minor version is officially released plus 1 month**. This is done by releasing patches that apply to each supported minor version.


## Maintenance Policy

Alauda provides maintenance support for the Alauda Support for PostgreSQL based on its rolling support model.

During the support period of each version, Alauda provides the following services:

- **Security Updates**: Regular patches and updates in line with Alauda's security standards.
- **Bug Fixes**: Timely fixes for critical and major issues, aligned with upstream PostgreSQL community fixes.
- **Upgrade Assistance**: Guidance and support for smooth upgrades between the Alauda Support for PostgreSQL versions.
